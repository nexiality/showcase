### Nexial Showcase

A collection of Nexial projects to showcase some of the capabilities of 
[Nexial Automation Platform](bit.ly/nexial). All projects listed here are free 
for anyone to use. No charge, no warranty, and likely no support. However we do 
try to put as much information in the README or the scripts themselves.

All inputs, collaborations, suggestions, etc. are welcome! Please feel free to
add yours here!
