# Introduction
A simple do-nothing project to validate that the target test harness and CI/CD set up is ready for prime time.

This project will exercise a few simple Nexial commands, including a visit to ep.com, as a form of readiness check. All are welcome to use this project as a starting point. Furthermore, additional Nexial commands or automations can be added - all suggestions and contributions welcome!

### **Keep calm and automate on!**
